\title{Calculates a transition matrix.}
\usage{
calculate_transitionMatrix(M, t)
}
\arguments{
\item{M}{Matrix containing all experimental data: the initial experimental setup matrix and the experimental cell state distribution matrices.}

\item{t}{This parameter is a vector with all timepoints at which the cell state distributions have been experimentally measured.}
}
\description{
This function derives the transition matrix which contains the transition probabilitites between the distinct cell states.
