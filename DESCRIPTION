Description: CellTrans is an automated tool to quantify stochastic cell state transitions between distinct cell states from FACS and flow cytometry experiments, to estimate equilibrium cell state proportions and the needed time equilibrium. In the new version (CellTrans2), it is also possible to visualise the transition matrices, one of CellTrans' solutions, as interaction graphs. Furthermore, CellTrans2 has the functionality to dynamically change the inputs for the calculations and in particular the value of Tau, which indicates the frequency of cell state transitions.
