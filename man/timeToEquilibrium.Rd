\usage{
timeToEquilibrium(
  expData,
  timepoints,
  datapoints,
  cell_types,

  distributionForEquilibrium,
  tol
)
}
\arguments{
\item{distributionForEquilibrium}{The starting proportions of the cell states as vector, e.g. c(1,0,..,0).}

\item{tol}{The tolerance deviation from the equilibrium distribution.}

\item{input}{A datalist generated by the function readExperimentaldata().}
}
\description{
This function estimates the time from any intitial cell state proportions until the equilibrium proportions. The variable input contains the read data from the function readExperimentalData(). The variable distributionForEquilibrium is a vector describing the initial cell state proportions, for example c(0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25) for equal proportions of 4 cell types. The third parameter tol is a tolerance deviation between the cell state proportions of the equilibrium distribution and those of the predicted cell state proportions for each cell state. For the parameter tol, we recommend values between 0.01 and 0.02.
