#' Quasi-optimization of a matrix root to a stochastic matrix.
#'
#' QOM finds a transition matrix that is as close as possible, with respect to the Euclidean distance of the rows, to the fractional root of a given transition matrix. If the argument is a transition matrix, this matrix is returned unchanged.
#' @param A The fractional root of a matrix that shall be regularized.
#' @keywords QOM, matrix root regularization
